## Test Endpoints Script

The repository includes a test script (`scripts/test-endpoints.js`) that helps validate the performance and functionality of the endpoints. The script:

1. Tests endpoints across different pages (Homepage, Browse, Item Detail)
2. Compares response times between local and production environments
3. Identifies slow queries (>1s response time)
4. Provides detailed performance metrics and status codes

### How to Run the Tests

You can run the tests using npm:

```bash
npm run test:endpoints
```

Or directly with node:

```bash
node scripts/test-endpoints.js
```

The script will:
- Test all configured endpoints
- Compare local vs production response times
- Show performance summaries
- Identify slow queries
- Display detailed results with status codes

### Test Output

The script provides:
- Status of each endpoint (✅ success or ❌ failure)
- Response times for both local and production environments
- Performance comparison between environments
- List of slow queries (>1s response time)
- Overall winner summary (local vs production)
- Detailed results for each endpoint

### Endpoints Tested

The script tests the following page scenarios:

#### Homepage
- Sales endpoints
- NFTs endpoints
- Catalog endpoints
- Items endpoints

#### Browse Page
- Prices endpoints
- Catalog endpoints with various sorting options

#### Item Detail Page
- Items endpoints
- Orders endpoints
- Sales endpoints
- Bids endpoints
